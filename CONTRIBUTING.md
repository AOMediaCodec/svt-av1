# How to Contribute

We welcome community contributions to the SVT-AV1 Encoder. Thank you for your time! By contributing to the project, you agree to the license and copyright terms in the OSI-approved BSD+Patent license and to the release of your contribution under these terms. See [LICENSE](LICENSE.md) for details.

## Contribution process

- Follow the [coding guidelines](STYLE.md)
- Validate that your changes do not break a build
  - either locally or through travis-ci and appveyor. Preferably all of them.
- Perform smoke tests and ensure they pass
- Submit a pull request for review to the maintainer

## Pull request process:

- Make commits concise and to the point (1 feature / issue = 1 commit )
- Authors would be responsible for breaking down the PR into commits that make sense (with proper commit messages)
- Use rebase and merge for all PRs to make sure that all commits are carried over to the master
- Maintainers would only use squash and merge with the permission of the authors.
